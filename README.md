<p align="center"> This project was done with the intention to understand more about how JS works with LocalStorage manipulation. </p>

## Project

You can find the project completed [here](https://thalfor.github.io/JS_postit)

---

## Code

The code was divided in 3 parts:

- HTML
- CSS
- JS

---

## Using the app

We have:

- To create a note click on the "+" button.
- To delete a note click twice on the note, a popup will appear asking if you want to delete it or not.
- To alter an existing note just click and type again, it will automatically save.

Since it's saved on the LocalStorage as long as you are using in the same browser you'll have it saved.
